    <p>
      Hello! I'm John Pert Millena, a 21-year-old aspiring Software Engineer hailing from Linmansangan, Binalonan, Pangasinan. 
      Currently in my second year at Pangasinan State University Urdaneta City Campus, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology, I am passionate about programming and technology.
      Driven by a curiosity for lucrative opportunities, I embarked on a journey into programming, realizing its potential to not only capture my interest but also pave the way for a fulfilling career. 
      My goal is to make the most of my time at PSU, receiving top-notch education to compete on an international level and bring pride to my family.
      As I continue to learn and grow, my ambition is to establish myself as a well-known Software Engineer. 
      Join me on my academic and professional journey as I strive to hone my skills and expand my knowledge in the dynamic world of programming.
